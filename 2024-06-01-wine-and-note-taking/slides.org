- What is the difference between PÃ©t-Nat and Method Ancestrale?
- Where is Nadia Verrua?
- What the heck is Emacs?

- *Extensible* text editor.
- Development began in 1970s.
- Initially released in 1976.
- Actively maintained till this day.
- Use ~C-x C-c~ to quit it.
- It's like Notepad/TextEdit, but for nerdy and masochistic kids.
- It's counter-intuitive, but some people do in fact love Emacs.

[fn:1] I still ask myself this very question.

* I drink wine

** I +love+ need[fn:2] to take notes

1. Information about wine, producer, region, grape, technology, etc.
2. Score and tasting notes.
3. What, when, where and with whom.
4. Manage cellar.

[fn:2] Is it Obsessive-compulsive disorder? Nah, it's just my crappy memory.

** CellarTracker Cons

- +UI+
- Complexity.
- 67 users from UA.
  - 5 users with >100 reviews.

* And the winner is...

** No one, really

- Vivino is leader because of community.
- I wish Delectable didn't fail in the core feature.
- CellarTracker is superior, obviously.

** So what's wrong?

1. Data is not owned by me.
2. Incorrect data.
3. No way to extend data with extra fields.
4. Capabilities limited by proprietary solution.
5. Requires internet connection (and who is laughing now?).
6. ...
7. I am engineer, I am capable of creating my own solution.

** What are my options?

- Notebooks (plain and specialised)
- Spreadsheets
- AirTable
- Notion
- <2-> Emacs

** Obviously...

#+attr_latex: :height 3.5cm
[[file:images/emacs.png]]

#+begin_quote
Solution? +Kafka+ Emacs.

Problem? You tell me.

--- a wise man
#+end_quote

** What's wrong about AirTable/Notion?                             :noexport:

- Too much manual work.
- Hard to analyse.
- Hard to write automations (info might be outdated).
- Still not everything is under /my/ control.
- Sometimes blocked by platform (e.g. waiting for features).
- Requires internet connection.

It's actually good enough. My wife still uses Airtable to manage our home library.

** Important aspects

- Evolutionary approach
- Automation
- Fun

* Emacs as a wine app

** Org Mode for the rescue

** So what?

- I have org files as source of truth. These notes are *well-structured*.
- I have APIs to manipulate these files.
- I have database with all data extracted (so there is no need to parse these files every time).

* Emacs UI is ugly, isn't it? And no one can read your notes.

** And it's crazy cool

- I can keep my private notes as the source of truth.

- But thanks to structured notes and APIs I can build multiple views.

- Just think about it :) I am overly excited!

** There's more

- Barberry Garden budget is managed with small Emacs extension based on ledger.
- I have a view that suggests what to post to Vivino (e.g. what was not posted yet).
- For wine tasting events presentations are generated automatically from the event article.
- I have a simple script that provides me various stats for a given time frame.

But there is no time to cover it all, so don't worry.

** Why so complicated?

#+begin_quote
[â¦] org-mode is just a collection of lisp running in an editor. It cannot impose more complex features on you. *The genius of org-mode is that you will eventually impose more complex features on yourself.*

* Are you proud?

** Conclusion

- Avoid Emacs at all costs.
- Structured data is cool.
- APIs are cool.
- Combined they can solve lots of routine tasks and result in some interesting products.
- Don't hesitate to start your own project, even if you are solving your own problems.
- People around me are cool.
