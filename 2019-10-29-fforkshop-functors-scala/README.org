* Functional Forkshop: Part 2 - Monoids (Scala edition)

This is the second part of the Functional Forkshop - a series of introduction
workshops to the functional programming.

In this workshop we cover the following topics:

- Value constructors.
- Type constructors.
- Arity.
- Higher-order functions.
- Higher-order types.
- Functors.
- Applicative Functors.

Afterwards we solve two problems:

- Parsing combinators.
- Validation.

The tasks are located in a separate repository:
[[https://gitlab.com/wax-org/fforkshop-functors-scala][wax-org/fforkshop-functors-scala]].
