* Functional Forkshop: Part 1 - Monoids (Scala edition)

This is the first part of the Functional Forkshop - a series of introduction
workshops to the functional programming.

In this workshop we cover type classes, semigroups and monoids. Afterwards we
solve three problems exposing powers of monoids:

- Fibonacci numbers.
- Top used words across many books.
- Logging.

The tasks are located in a separate repository: [[https://github.com/wax-org/fforkshop-monoids-scala][wax-org/fforkshop-monoids-scala]].

Authors: [[https://github.com/valentynv][Valentyn Vakatsiienko]] and [[https://d12frosted.io][Boris Buliga]].
