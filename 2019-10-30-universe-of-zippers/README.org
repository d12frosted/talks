* Universe of Zippers (or how to plant a bomb)

This is a talk for [[https://www.meetup.com/functional-vilnius/events/265528343/][Functional Vilnius #13]] meetup.

In this talk we discover a pointed list data type (here it's called =Universe=,
it's a zipper like list) to solve three different problems:

- Elemental Cellular Automata
- Game of Life
- Bot for Bomberman

The =demo= contains all the code from the talk and even more, so you can play
with =Universe= by yourself. For this to work you should have =stack= installed.
By intend, you should load the interested module into =ghci=.

There are some additional materials related to =Builder= pattern which are not
part of the final PDF file, so if you are interested - take a look at the ORG
file (Act 4) and in the =Data.Builder= module of the =demo=

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or troubles with
running the examples.
