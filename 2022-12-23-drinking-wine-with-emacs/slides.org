* Emacs

** What is Emacs?[fn:1]

- *Extensible* text editor.
- Development began in 1970s.
- Initially released in 1976.
- Actively maintained till this day.
- Use ~C-x C-c~ to quit it.

[fn:1] Daria Tkhorevska asked me to be explicit that no one actually asked this question during Yaniv and Aviran Q&A session. I made the whole story up.

* I drink wine

** I +love+ need[fn:2] to take notes

1. What, when, where and with whom.
2. Score and tasting notes.
3. Information about wine, producer, region, grape, technology, etc.
4. Manage cellar (inventory?).

[fn:2] Is it Obsessive-compulsive disorder?

** What about existing solutions (CellarTracker/Vivino/Delectable)?

1. Data is not owned by me.
2. Incorrect data.
3. No way to extend data with extra fields.
4. Capabilities limited by proprietary solution.
5. Requires internet connection (and who is laughing now?).
6. ...
7. I am engineer, I am capable of creating my own solution.

* Solution

** Obviously...

Solution? +Kafka+ Emacs.

Problem? You tell me.

** Airtable/Notion

** Issues

- Too much manual work.
- Hard to analyse.
- Hard to write automations (might be outdated).
- Still not everything is under /my/ control.
- Sometimes blocked by platform (e.g. waiting for features).

It's actually good enough. My wife still uses Airtable to manage our home library.

** Org Mode for the rescue

*** About                                                          :B_column:

:BEAMER_col:             0.75
:END:

- A markup language (like markdown, but beefed with features).
- An extension for Emacs.
- Provides nice APIs to manipulate documents.
- People use it to write documents, notes, presentations manage tasks and projects, etc.

** Rating

** Database

- All notes (e.g. data) are structured.
- There are APIs to parse these notes.
- So it's easy to build a database (=sqlite=) from the notes.

** Vulpea

*** About                                                          :B_column:

- A collection of functions for note taking based on Org Mode and Org Roam.
- A library to write applications and utilities around Org notes (structured or not).
- Optimized for reads.
- Allows to query by different metadata, custom fields, links etc.
- Allows to extend database with custom tables and data extractors.
- Handles quite big notes collection (10k+).

** Vino

- An Emacs application for cellar tracking and wine notes management.

** So what?

- I have org files as source of truth. These notes are *well-structured*.
- I have APIs to manipulate these files.
- I have database with all data extracted (so there is no need to parse these files every time).

* Emacs UI is ugly, isn't it? And no one can read your notes.

** And it's crazy cool

- I can keep my private notes as the source of truth.
- I have my cozy Emacs UI.
- But thanks to structured notes and APIs I can build multiple views.
- ...
- Just think about it :) I am overly excited!

* Some cool features

** Code blocks execution

** Convive page

** There's more

- Barberry Garden budget is managed with small Emacs extension based on Vulpea.
- Plans for tasting events are managed  with small Emacs extension based on Vulpea.
- I have a view to review my cellar (scattered across 3 places).
- I have a view that suggests what to post to Vivino (e.g. what was not posted yet).
- For wine tasting events presentations are generated automatically (no shit) from the event article.
- I have a simple script that provides me various stats for a given time frame.

But there is no time to cover it all, so don't worry.

** Why so complicated?

#+begin_quote
[â€¦] org-mode is just a collection of lisp running in an editor. It cannot impose more complex features on you. *The genius of org-mode is that you will eventually impose more complex features on yourself.*

--- Michael Hall
#+end_quote

** Conclusion

- Avoid Emacs at all costs.
- Structured data is cool.
- APIs are cool.
- Combined they can solve lots of routine tasks and result in some interesting products.
- Don't hesitate to start your own project, even if you are solving your own problems.
- Drink wine.

** Seriously, drink wine
